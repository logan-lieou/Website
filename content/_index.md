is to build software to drive our innovation without having to constantly rewrite the code.

Software Engineering is about reinventing the wheel.

Here's the reality.

As I read articles on other programmers, I see them doing what is possible while they're working with other technical developers who are not, or aren't motivated by that passion. Maybe it's the people who have spent years helping others build projects (some of them people you've worked with with on the other side of the planet), or the people who are creating the design for software to go live. Maybe it's the people working on projects that are far, away more valuable to us than the team in front of us.

And maybe it's the people in that team who are the most valuable people in the world.

I am thinking of using software by definition to drive things we might not otherwise accomplish, to provide a means for other people, for businesses to pay for things, to create software to drive other things (and vice versa).

What makes this approach successful, and what makes it not so successful, is its flexibility.

If what I'm about to do isn't working, and I'm willing to get involved with a project that's already built, I can do it again.

It's not something to make myself. It's something to give others a chance at paying for anything that isn't already there, to give them another
