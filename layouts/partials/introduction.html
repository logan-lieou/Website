	My mission as a software engineer is to build software to drive our
	innovation without having to constantly rewrite the code.

	Software Engineering is about reinventing the wheel.

	And maybe it's the people in that team who are the most valuable people in the
	world.

	I am thinking of using software by definition to drive things we might not
	otherwise accomplish, to provide a means for other people, for businesses to
	pay for things, to create software to drive other things (and vice versa).

	It's not something to make myself. It's something to give others a chance at
	paying for anything that isn't already there, to give them another chance.
